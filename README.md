# Temperature Monitoring and Control System

## Overview
This project is a temperature monitoring and control system built with an ESP32 microcontroller. It uses an LM35 temperature sensor to continuously monitor ambient temperature and automatically controls a relay to manage connected equipment (like cooling or heating systems). The system includes an OLED display for real-time information, LED indicators, alarm functionality, and Blynk IoT integration for remote monitoring and control.

## Features
- **Real-time Temperature Monitoring**: Uses LM35 temperature sensor for accurate readings
- **Automatic Control**: Activates/deactivates a relay based on configurable temperature thresholds
- **Visual Feedback**:
  - OLED display showing current temperature, system status, and relay state
  - LED indicators for relay status (ON/OFF)
- **Audio Alerts**: Different buzzer patterns for various states (overheat, recovery, system toggle)
- **Manual Control**: Physical button to toggle system operation
- **Remote Monitoring and Control**: Blynk IoT platform integration allows monitoring and control from anywhere
- **Fail-safe Operation**: System can work offline if WiFi/Blynk connection is unavailable

### Components
| Component       | ESP32 Pin |
|-----------------|-----------|
| LM35 Sensor     | GPIO34    |
| Relay           | GPIO5     |
| Button          | GPIO13    |
| Buzzer          | GPIO18    |

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone this repository or download the source code
2. Install required libraries through Arduino Library Manager
3. Create a Blynk account and set up a new project
4. Replace the following credentials in the code:
   ```cpp
   #define BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID "TMPL3MCE-W-US"
   #define BLYNK_TEMPLATE_NAME "TempControl"
   #define BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN "rpbJiYaLbjx23ra69y84uos5Xge_dRlS"
   
   char ssid[] = "your-wifi-ssid";
   char pass[] = "your-wifi-password";
   


## Blynk Project Setup
In your Blynk app:
1. Create a new project
2. Add the following widgets with corresponding virtual pins:
      - Value Display (V0): For temperature readings
      - Value Display (V1): For relay status
      - Value Display (V2): For system status
      - Value Display (V3): For voltage
      - Value Display (V4): For overheat status
      - Button (V5): For toggling system on/off

## Operation
- Normal Operation: When temperature is below threshold (30¬∞C), the relay is ON
- Overheat Condition: When temperature exceeds threshold, relay turns OFF and alarm sounds
- Manual Control: Press the physical button to toggle system ON/OFF
- Remote Control: Use the Blynk app to monitor and control the system

## Customization
  - Temperature threshold can be adjusted by changing const float temperatureThreshold = 30.0;
  - Alarm sounds and durations can be modified in the corresponding arrays
  - Update intervals can be adjusted for different components:
      - Temperature reading: const unsigned long updateInterval = 2000;
      - Blynk updates: const unsigned long blynkUpdateInterval = 1000;

## Troubleshooting
- If the OLED display fails to initialize, check the I2C connections and address
- If Blynk connection fails, the system will operate in offline mode
- For inaccurate temperature readings, check the LM35 sensor connections and power supply
