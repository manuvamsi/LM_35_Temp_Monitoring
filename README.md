# Temperature Monitoring and Control System

## Overview
This project is a temperature monitoring and control system built with an ESP32 microcontroller. It uses an LM35 temperature sensor to continuously monitor ambient temperature and automatically controls a relay to manage connected equipment (like cooling or heating systems). The system includes an OLED display for real-time information, LED indicators, alarm functionality, and Blynk IoT integration for remote monitoring and control.

## Features
- **Real-time Temperature Monitoring**: Uses LM35 temperature sensor for accurate readings
- **Automatic Control**: Activates/deactivates a relay based on configurable temperature thresholds
- **Visual Feedback**:
  - OLED display showing current temperature, system status, and relay state
  - LED indicators for relay status (ON/OFF)
- **Audio Alerts**: Different buzzer patterns for various states (overheat, recovery, system toggle)
- **Manual Control**: Physical button to toggle system operation
- **Remote Monitoring and Control**: Blynk IoT platform integration allows monitoring and control from anywhere
- **Fail-safe Operation**: System can work offline if WiFi/Blynk connection is unavailable

## Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 development board
- LM35 temperature sensor
- 0.96" OLED display (SSD1306, I2C interface)
- 5V relay module
- Piezo buzzer
- 2 LEDs (for relay status indication)
- Push button
- Resistors and connecting wires
- 5V power supply

## Software Dependencies
- Arduino IDE
- Libraries:
  - `Wire.h` - For I2C communication
  - `Adafruit_GFX.h` - Graphics library for the OLED display
